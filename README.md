# malrev
A lightweight tool to reverse engineer and analyze suspicious files

🛠️ Malware Reverse Engineering Tool
This is a Malware Reverse Engineering Tool — a lightweight, C++-based utility designed for analyzing binary files and extracting useful indicators.

This tool is built with speed, portability, and clarity in mind. Whether you’re a malware analyst, a cybersecurity student, or just a curious reverse engineer, this project is meant to help you dig into suspicious binaries without the bloat.

📜 What This Tool Does
Think of this tool as your first-pass triage assistant.
It can:

Scan binary files for known byte signatures.

Generate a clean HTML/JSON report of findings.

Work offline without requiring large dependencies.

Be extended with your own custom detection signatures.

It’s not a replacement for IDA Pro, Ghidra, or Binary Ninja — but it’s a quick, simple, and automated first look.

🏗️ How It Works
You feed it a binary (e.g., suspicious .exe or .dll).

It reads through the file’s contents.

It checks against predefined signatures.

It spits out results in a report.json (machine-readable) and optionally report.html (human-friendly).

📦 Installation & Build
Prerequisites
CMake (>= 3.10)

A C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC all work)

Git (optional, but nice to have)

Build Instructions (Windows)

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malrev.git
cd malrev

# 2. Create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# 3. Run CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# 4. Build
cmake --build . --config Release
You’ll find the malrev.exe inside build/Release/.

Build Instructions (Linux / macOS)

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malrev.git
cd malrev

# 2. Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# 3. Run CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# 4. Build
make
The compiled binary will be in build/.

🚀 Usage

# Basic usage
malrev <path_to_binary>

# Example
malrev suspicious.exe
After running, you’ll get:

report.json — structured scan results for automation.

report.html — a clean, human-readable version of the findings.

🧩 Adding Custom Signatures
Signatures are stored in signatures.json.
Here’s a simple example:

[
  {
    "name": "Suspicious API Call",
    "pattern": "LoadLibraryA",
    "description": "May indicate dynamic loading of DLLs."
  }
]
Just add more entries, rebuild, and you’re ready to detect new threats.

📚 Future Plans
YARA rule integration.

PE/ELF/Mach-O metadata extraction.

Entropy analysis for packed/encrypted sections.

❤️ A Note from the Author
I built this tool to help security researchers save time on repetitive triage tasks.
If it saves you even a few minutes, I consider it a win.
Stay curious, stay safe, and happy reversing!
